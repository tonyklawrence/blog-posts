## A simple template using

* Ant to build (as it's fast)
* ShavenMaven for dependencies (as it's fast)
* Yadic for dependency injection (as it's fast)
* Totallylazy for functional stuff (I like it)
* Utterlyidle for REST (as it's easy)
* JUnit, JMock, Hamcrest & Yatspec (for testing)

Not sure why I need Funclate & StringTemplate.
Would be nice to remove these and even add something like Moustache?
